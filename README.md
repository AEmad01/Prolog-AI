# Prolog-AI
In this problem we try to model a search agent called Ethan. The year is 1969 and the cold
war is at its peak. Tensions between the United States (USA) and the Soviet Union (USSR)
reached unprecedented levels. A double agent leaked the USSR’s plan to the American
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As the stakes could not be higher, the CIA turned to its
most renowned agent and the leader of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), Ethan Hunt.
Ethan flied to an undiscovered island, however their helicopter malfunctioned and everyone
had to jump out. Everybody except Ethan is badly injured and is about to die. It is
Ethan’s mission now to bring all IMF members to the submarine using a truck that has a
fixed capacity. The island they crashed is a grid that consists of m x n cells where m,n are
between 1 and 2. Each cell either contains Ethan (with the truck), an ally or the submarine.
Ethan can move all in all directions across the grid, can carry IMF members and can only
drop them at the submarine.
